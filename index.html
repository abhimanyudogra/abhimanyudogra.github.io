            <h2>My name is Abhimanyu Dogra, and I am a Software Programmer</h2>
            <p>Currently, I am a final year Computer Science Engineering student, studying in Thapar University, Patiala. Since January 2014, I am working as a Software Development intern at proprietary firm that deals with HFT Trading algorithms. Besides being busy with work related projects, I keep myself engrossed in  projects related to programming that touch the subjects of my interest like Artificial Intelligence and Python Scripting.
			Other than being an avid programmer, I am a guitar musician skilled in both acoustic and electric guitar. Gaming has been my passion since my father bought me System Shock in the nineties and I have played countless titles spanning across many genres. I am also a trekking enthusiast who has loved being in the serene cradle of nature.
